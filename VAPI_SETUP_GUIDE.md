# WorkCast VAPI Hiring Agent Setup Guide

## Overview

I've created a comprehensive VAPI agent configuration specifically designed for technical interviews in your WorkCast hiring platform. The agent "Alex" is now optimized for conducting professional, structured interviews that assess both technical skills and cultural fit.

## What's Changed

### 1. New Agent Persona: Alex
- **Role**: AI Technical Interviewer for WorkCast

```
"Hello! Welcome to your technical interview with WorkCast. I'm Alex, your AI interviewer, and I'm excited to learn more about you today. How has your day been going so far?"
```

### 3. Comprehensive Interview Structure

#### Phase 1: Welcome & Warm-up (2-3 minutes)
- Opening greeting and rapport building

// Frontend Developer Interview Agent
const frontendAgent = await createFrontendInterviewer("Frontend Interview Bot", "senior")

// Backend Developer Interview Agent  
const backendAgent = await createBackendInterviewer("Backend Interview Bot", "mid")
```

### Advanced Configuration

**Custom Hiring Agent**:
```typescript
import { createHiringAgent } from '@/lib/hiringAgents'

const customAgent = await createHiringAgent({
  name: "Senior React Developer Interviewer",

  customInstructions: "Focus heavily on React 18+ features, performance optimization, and team leadership experience."
})
```

   - Check assessment quality

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Authentication Errors**: Verify VAPI credentials in `.env`
