// How this works?
// It only renders once. When the bundle is loaded, it will render the layout. It bundles in and cahces the layout.
// Otherwise it can lead to authentication issues if the layout is not cached.

// What we will do is authenticate user in this layout page, but because this layout page is not re-rendered when it's called again, even if the user signs-out it's still gonna hold same context/data(cache).
// So we will have to put a check on every page that is protected, to check if the user is authenticated or not. (One drawback of this approach).

// Other way to go around this is to create a provider (clerk) and inside that we can use client state like useUser which gives the state of the user.
// Inside provide we can check state and based on that when the state update we can send the user back to the login page.
